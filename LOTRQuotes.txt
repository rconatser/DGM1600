THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING QUOTES
Gandalf: A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.

Frodo Baggins: I wish the ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.
Gandalf: So do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us

Sauron: You can not hide, I see you! There is no life, after me. Only!.. Death!

Gandalf: YOU SHALL NOT PASS!

Frodo Baggins: Mordor! I hope the others find a safer road.
Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee: Strider'll look after them.
Frodo Baggins: I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.
Samwise 'Sam' Gamgee: We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may.
Frodo Baggins: Sam? I'm glad you're with me.

Bilbo Baggins: No, thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!
Gandalf: And what about very old friends?
Bilbo Baggins: Gandalf?
Gandalf: Bilbo Baggins.
Bilbo Baggins: My dear Gandalf!
Gandalf: Good to see you, 111 years old! Who would believe it? You haven't aged a day.

Frodo Baggins: I think we should get off the road. Get off the road! Quick!

Gimli: Not the beard!

Legolas: Lembas! Elvish waybread. One small bite is enough to fill a stomach of a grown man.
Meriadoc 'Merry' Brandybuck: Merry: How many did you eat?
Pippin: Four.

Gandalf: so do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide the thing to decide is the time that is giving to us.

Gimli: I will be dead before I see the ring in the hands of an elf! Never trust an elf!
