Well here we are again
It's always such a pleasure
Remember when you tried
to kill me twice?

Oh how we laughed and laughed
Except I wasn't laughing
Under the circumstances
I've been shockingly nice

You want your freedom?
Take it
That's what I'm counting on
I used to want you dead
but
Now I only want you gone

She was a lot like you
(Maybe not quite as heavy)
Now little Caroline is in here too

One day they woke me up
So I could live forever
It's such a shame the same
will never happen to you

You've got your
short sad life left
That's what I'm counting on
I'll let you get right to it
Now I only want you gone

Goodbye my only friend
Oh, did you think I meant you?
That would be funny
if it weren't so sad

Well you have been replaced
I don't need anyone now
When I delete you maybe
I'll stop feeling so bad

Go make some new disaster
That's what I'm counting on
You're someone else's problem
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone
Now I only want you gone

Connection to game/GLaDOS

Well, here we are again - Portal 2 being the sequel to Portal.
Remember when you tried to kill me twice? - The events of Portal.
Now I only want you gone - GLaDOS deciding not to kill Chell and letting her go.
Now little Caroline is in here too - Caroline is the personality GLaDOS was based on.
Goodbye my only friend - GLaDOS deleting Caroline's personality from her memory.
Well you have been replaced // I don't need anyone now // When I delete you maybe // I'll stop feeling so bad - Chell being replaced by Atlas and P-Body as GLaDOS's main test subject. Another interpretation might be that GLaDOS is referring to Caroline rather than Chell meaning deleting Caroline will free GLaDOS of emotions. This interpretation is less consistent with the concept of replacement in this lyric since Caroline is not being replaced at all, Chell is. It is likely this series of lyrics is a blended reference to both Chell and Caroline.
